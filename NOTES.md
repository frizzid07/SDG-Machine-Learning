## Why Python?
* Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
* Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
* Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
* Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
* Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-orientated way or a functional way.

## Why Use NumPy ?
* In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.
* NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster that traditional Python lists.
* The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.
* Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important.

## Why use Pandas?
* pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive.
* It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python.
